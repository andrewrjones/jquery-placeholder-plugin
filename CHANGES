0.3 28-01-2011
This release brings in Mal Curtis' work from https://github.com/snikch/jquery-placeholder-plugin/. Each of the changes in this version are attributed to him (which means he has probably wrote more of the code than I have ;-)

  [Setting Changes]
  - 'blurClass' has been renamed to 'activeClass'
  - 'activeClass' has been renamed to 'focusClass'
  
  [Enhancements]
  - 'preventRefreshIssues' optional setting added to prevent Firefox from auto filling values on refresh, by turning autocomplete off. Defaults to true
  
  [Bug Fixes]
  - If the value is actually set to the same as the placeholder, it's still considered a placeholder
  - Refresh in firefox pre fills the input field with the placeholder
  - Val() function returns the placeholder, not an empty string
  - Submitting a form would submit the placeholder value
  - Changing the value of an element with a placeholder via val('string') will removed the placeholder class
